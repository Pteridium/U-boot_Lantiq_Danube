This repository is only intended to build u-boot images for
some Lantiq Danube based boards:
easy50712
easy50812
arv4518PW
arv4520PW
arv4525PW
arv452CPW
arv7518PW
arv752DPW
arv752DPW22

The features included are tftp and httpd. The tests were made
with ARV4518PW and ARV7518PW. U-boot worked as expected on them.

More Lantiq Danube based boards could be added upon request.

=================================================================

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex,
make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use scripts/flashing/flash.sh for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type make -C docs/ to build it.

Building your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system.
Cygwin will not be supported because of the lack of case sensitiveness.

Sunshine!
